# Overview 

## Streams

Streams are payment contracts that exist on the blockchain to facilitate an easier method of payment. You can program streams by specifying a total payment amount, a recipient, and a timeframe. Once a payment stream is created, the funds for the payment are locked in the stream's smart contract. Over the course of the payment timeframe, the payment stream unlocks an equal amount of funds every block, and the recipient of the stream can claim their unlocked income. 

Streams are a form of NFT Payment Contracts (NFTPC), which can be thought of as a tokenized smart contract. NFTPCs enable payment streams to be transferred or sent to other addresses or used like an NFT. NFTPCs are minted anytime a payment stream is created. 

### Create

When a stream is created, a user specifies a recipient, an amount, a start and end date for payments, and whether the contract can be [modified](#modify). 

### Claim

Recipients of a stream can claim their stream income as it is released. 

### Modify

During creation, users can specify whether streams can be **modified** after being created. Streams that can be modified are *mutable*, and can be [canceled](#cancel) or [funded](#fund). 

Streams that cannot be modified are immutable and cannot be changed after being created. Unmodifiable streams cannot be canceled or funded.  


### Fund

Users can fund a stream to increase the total amount of tokens paid out per block. Funding does not increase the time period of a stream, it only increases the release volume per block based on the funding amount. Only a modifiable stream can be funded. 

### Cancel

The creator of a stream can cancel a modifiable stream. Once canceled, all funds released up to the time of cancellation are held for the recipient to claim. The remaining unreleased amount is sent to a specified account.
