<Admonition type="caution" icon="⛓️" title="Cross-chain sends">
When sending assets to another chain, Station will automatically route the asset. If the asset is not available on the chain you are trying to send to, a warning will appear. Be sure to read all warnings carefully. Some assets may need to be sent back to their origin chain before being sent to another chain.

Cross-chain transactions may also require gas tokens for the destination and origin chains. Station will evaluate your route and prompt you to purchase the correct gas tokens should you need them. Then, you can continue your cross-chain transaction.

    alt="swap"

Congratulations, you've just completed a swap!

<Admonition type="tip" icon="⛓️" title="Fee top-ups">

If your swap requires fees to be paid in other assets that you don't have, Station will prompt you to top up your fees. Station will guide you through this process, swapping for enough of an asset to pay for fees. Station estimates the fees, allows you to choose how much of the fee token you want to swap for, and then performs the swap, enabling you to continue with your transaction.
