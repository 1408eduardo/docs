## Stake Luna

Staking is the act of delegating all or part of your Luna balance as your stake to a validator, who will participate in the process of validating transactions. By staking, you earn rewards.

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. Select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate**. A new window will appear.

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate, and click **Next**.

::: warning Keep coins for fees
Always keep some coins to pay fees with. Never spend your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can't make any transactions.
:::

5. Double check the amounts and fees. Enter your password and click **Delegate**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake Luna. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Terra Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow these steps to withdraw them:

1. Open Terra Station and click **Staking**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards only from a single validator, click on their name in the list and click **withdraw** on their page.  A new window will appear.

2. Review the amounts and specify which coin you want to pay fees in.

3. Enter your password and click **withdraw**.

Congratulations, you've just withdrawn your staking rewards!
