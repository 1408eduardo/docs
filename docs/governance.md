# Governance

Governance is the process by which Terra network participants can effect change for the protocol, by collectively demonstrating consensus support for proposals.

## Proposals

Proposals start out as ideas within the community. A member drafts a proposal into a specific format and submits the proposal alongside an initial deposit.

Proposals that can be automatically applied include:

- `ParameterChangeProposal`: a change to blockchain parameters (defined in each module).
- `TaxRateUpdateProposal`: an update to the Tax Rate monetary policy lever
- `RewardWeightUpdateProposal`: an update to the Reward Weight monetary policy lever.
- `CommunityPoolSpendProposal`: a proposal to disburse funds from the Distribution module's Community Pool.

Other issues like large directional changes or decisions requiring human involvement (manual implementation) can also be voted on by submitting a plain `TextProposal`.

Proposals are submitted by creating a proposal, depositing some Luna tokens, and reaching consensus through a community vote.
