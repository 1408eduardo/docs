## General info

Per [governance proposal 1623](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1623), a new chain will be created and will assume the Terra name. 

1. The original chain will still function and be re-branded as **Terra Classic**. 
    - The original Cosmos chain will still run, with market swaps (mint/burn function) disabled. 
    - All balances will remain as they are.
    - Luna will become Luna Classic (LUNC).
    - Stablecoins (UST, KRT, EUT, etc.) will remain. 


2. The new chain will be called **Terra**, and will assume all Terra branding assets.
    - The new chain is also a Cosmos chain, but will not have the treasury, oracle, or market modules of the original chain. 
    - The new chain's native mining token will be Luna. 
    - There will be no Terra stablecoins (UST, KRT, EUT, etc.) on the new chain. 
    - The new chain's Luna will be distributed according to the [governance proposal](https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-ecosystem-revival-plan-2-updated-and-final/18498), including weighted airdrops of Luna to previous aUST and LUNA holders of the original chain. 

## Branding

The old chain will be branded Terra Classic. The new chain will assume the name "Terra." 

### Naming convention:

**Terra Classic**

The original Terra chain will be rebranded as Terra Classic.

- Official chain name: Terra Classic
- All Luna currently on exchanges needs to be renamed Luna Classic (LUNC). 
- All Terra stablecoins will retain their original naming convention: TerraUSD(UST) 

**Terra**:

The new chain will assume the name Terra. 

- Official chain name: Terra
- Luna (LUNA) will be the main staking asset of the chain.
- The new chain does not contain any Terra stablecoins (UST, KRT, etc.).

### Logos and assets

Please update all logos and branding according to the following conventions. 

**Terra Classic**:

The old chain will be rebranded using Terra Classic brand assets, including new logos for both LUNC and UST. You will need to remove all current Logos from the original chain and implement the Terra Classic brand assets on your exchange. You can download these assets from the link below:
