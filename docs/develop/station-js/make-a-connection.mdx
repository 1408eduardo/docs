# Make a connection

Users can interact with the blockchain by using the following modes:

- Querying data
- Broadcasting a transaction

## Connect to a chain

To perform these actions, connect to the blockchain by using an `InterchainLCDClient` object, which represents a connection to a node running the light client daemon (LCD). The LCD serves as a RESTful API over HTTP. station.js abstracts away the details of making raw API calls and provide an interface with which you can work.

```ts
import { InterchainLCDClient } from '@terra-money/station.js';

const terra = new InterchainLCDClient({
  URL: 'https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev',
  chainID: 'phoenix-1',
});
```
