# terrad rollback

Tollback the Terra-sdk and Tendermint state by one height. 

## Synopsis

A state rollback is performed to recover from an incorrect application state transition,
when Tendermint has persisted an incorrect app hash and is thus unable to make
progress. Rollback overwrites a state at height `n` with the state at height `n - 1`.
The application also roll back to height `n - 1`. No blocks are removed, so upon
restarting Tendermint the transactions in block `n` will be re-executed against the
application.

## Usage

```sh Terrad
terrad rollback [flags]
```

## Options

```sh Terrad
  -h, --help          help for rollback
      --home string   The application home directory (default "terra")
```
