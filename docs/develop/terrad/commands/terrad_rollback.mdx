# terrad rollback

Tollback the Blockchain and Tendermint state by one height.  

## Synopsis

A state rollback is performed to recover from an incorrect application state transition,
when Tendermint has persisted an incorrect app hash and is thus unable to make
progress. Rollback overwrites a state at height _`n`_ with the state at height _`n - 1`_.
The application also roll back to height _`n - 1`_. No blocks are removed, so upon
restarting Tendermint the transactions in block _`n`_ will be re-executed against the
application.

## Usage

```sh Terrad
terrad rollback [flags]
```

## Options

```sh Terrad
  -h, --help          help for rollback
      --home string   The application home directory (default "terra")
```
