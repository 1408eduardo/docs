# terrad query ibc channel unreceived-acks

Query all the unreceived acknowledgements(`ack`) associated with a channel. 

## Synopsis

Given a list of acknowledgement sequences from counterparty, determine if an `ack` on the counterparty chain has been received on the executing chain.

The return value represents:
- Unreceived packet acknowledgement: packet commitment exists on the original sending (executing) chain and `ack` exists on receiving chain.

```sh Terrad
terrad query ibc channel unreceived-acks [port-id] [channel-id] --sequences=1,2,3
