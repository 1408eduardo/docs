# Migrate to Interchain Station

Use this guide to import an existing wallet into Station.

## Prerequisites

- Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- Download the [Terra Station Chrome extension](Download/terra-station-extension.mdx) and [create a wallet](Download/terra-station-extension.mdx#create-a-wallet).
- Make sure you have access to your seed phrase.

## Import an existing Station wallet

To access other chains on Station you'll need to re-add your wallet. If you choose not to, you will still have access to the private key and funds associated with that wallet but you will not be able to interact with other chains.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="ℹ️">
  Station needs to derive your wallet address for each chain from the same seed
  phrase. Station must re-load the seed phrase in order to detect tokens held in
  wallets that were created via the 118 path. Read more
  [here](../../../docs/develop/feather-js/keys.mdx#mnemonickey).

1. Open your extension popup and click on your wallet name in the top navigation bar.
