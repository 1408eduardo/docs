# Terra

## Introduction

Terra is a distributed ledger of account balances maintained by validators. These validators follow the Tendermint DPoS algorithm and vote on blocks. In order to become a validator, one must demonstrate investment in the Terra protocol by staking their Luna tokens, a sign of skin-in-the-game that aligns their incentives with maintaining the integrity of the ledger, at the risk of losing their staked deposit. The Luna token is the native staking asset recognized by the Terra protocol and represents mining power, granting its staking validator access to transaction fees and miner rewards, allowing them to benefit from increased user adoption and growth within the Terra ecosystem.
