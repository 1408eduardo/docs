# Quickstart

This is a short tutorial to get quickly started with using Terra.

## Download Terra Station

Start off by downloading [Terra Station](https://terra.money/protocol.html#protocol1), the official desktop wallet for holding Terra assets. There are official binaries for Windows and macOS. Some people have reported success with installing Terra Station on Linux through WINE, though currently it is not officially supported.

### Create a new Wallet

Launch Terra station and follow the instructions on the screen to create a new wallet. This will involve either generating a 24-word mnemonic phrase or loading an existing mnemonic.

Be sure to write down and verify the 24 words -- whoever has them can access your funds.
