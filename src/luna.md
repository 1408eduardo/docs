# Luna

## What is Luna?

Luna is the native staking token recognized by the Terra protocol. Through its role in collateralizing the mechanisms that secure the price-stability of Terra stablecoins and modulate the incentives of validators, Luna serves as a foundational asset for the entire Terra network and ecosystem.

The primary function of Luna is to protect the integrity of Terra mechanisms by locking value within the Terra ecosystem through staking. 
As a staking token, Luna can exist in three states:

#### Unbonded

This is Luna that can be freely transacted as a regular token, with no restrictions.

#### Bonded

While Luna is bonded, it is considered **staked**, and generates rewards for the delegator and validator it is bonded to. The Luna cannot be freely traded, and is locked in the ecosystem until it is fully unbonded.

#### Unbonding

Luna that is instructed to be undelegated from a delegator transition into an "unbonding" state during which neither rewards accrue nor the Luna can be freely traded. This unbonding phase takes 21 days to complete, after which the Luna return to an unbonded state. 

::: warning NOTE

When Luna is undelegated, this action cannot be undone until the 21 days are completed.
